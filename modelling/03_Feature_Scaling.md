## Feature Scaling & Normalisation
**Q: what the effect of irregularity in the model performance?** [[medium]](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-scaling-and-normalisation-in-a-nutshell-5319af86f89b)
- Having features of different scale and range of values affect models with a distance-based approach
  - ie. tree-based models such as Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Feature scaling is the process of scaling the values of features in a dataset so that they proportionally contribute to the distance calculation
