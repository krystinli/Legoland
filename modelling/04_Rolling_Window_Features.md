- Predict what will happen next, or what will happen in next N weeks 
- The model, and required features + dependent variable, needs to be designed to accommodate the relative time element

## Q: Which customers will make a purchase in next 4 weeks? üõçÔ∏è
Given past sales data for 2 years from Jan 2019 to Dec 2020:

### Step (1): Build a rolling window features dataset
Choose a **reference date** and then base everything to be relative to this date:
- The timeframe post the reference date will become the **target window**
  - to check whether a customer bought anything or not
- All activity prior to the reference date will be summarized to get **features** for the model
- The chosen reference date can induce it‚Äôs own biases into the dataset
  - Especially if there is seasonality to the variable we are trying to predict

We can choose multiple reference dates spread out over a year or two:
- We can also randomly sample from the 24 reference dates

### Step (2): Target
Our target is to predict who will buy something in the next 4 weeks (1 or 0)
- For each `week_end`, we will create a flag variable that tells whether the customer bought something
- Then we can use the window definitions to agg the next 4 weeks relative to week_end
  - as the target variable for each week_end
- Similarly we will use the window definitions to agg various timeframes of the past year for all features
