# ML_101
- The science of making computers learn without programming them explicitly 
- Netflex recommendation system predicts user's preference for movies based on past ratings
- **Supervised Learning**: goals is to learn a general rule or function that maps inputs to outputs
  - The function is general enough and we try to minimize some err metrics on a held-out dataset.
- Examples of supervised learnings include:
  - [ ] Regression: target variable is continuous 
  - [ ] Logistic regression
  - [ ] Support vecotr machines
  - [ ] Neural networks
  - [ ] Decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosted machines
  - [ ] Classification: target variable (output) is categorial (ie. Y or N)
