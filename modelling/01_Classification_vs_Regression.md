## Logistic vs. Linear Regression ðŸ“ˆ
[[KDD]](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/03/linear-logistic-regression-succinct-explanation.html#:~:text=Linear%20Regression%20and%20Logistic%20Regression,used%20to%20solve%20Classification%20problems.) To recap, Supervised Learning is when the algorithm learns on a **labeled dataset** and analyses the training data. These labeled data sets **have inputs and expected outputs**:
- The relation between Linear vs Logistic Regression is the fact that they both use labeled datasets to make predictions
- However:
  - **1) Linear Regression** is used to solve Regression problems:
    - Predicting a **continuous** output
    - by finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables 
  - **2) Logistic Regression** is used to solve Classification problems:
    - Classification is about **predicting a label**
    - by identifying which category an object belongs to based on different parameters
