## A Guide to Time-Related Event Analysis ðŸ“†
 [[blog]](https://medium.com/geekculture/down-the-rabbit-hole-of-event-prediction-a-guide-to-time-related-event-analysis-and-beyond-7529591adada) Events prediction refers to forecasting the likelihood of a specific event occurring in the future:
- Examples: churn, customer loss; purchase; time series; failure
- Survival analysis: statiscal method used to analyze data on the time it takes for an event to occur

Types of Event Prediction:
- **Time series**: predicting future values in a time-dependent series
  - Can be useful for forecasting demand for a product/service/predicting financial market trends
- **Purchase Prediction**: whether a customer will make a purchase in the future
  - Can be useful for business in order to target marketing campaigns / understand cust behaviour 
- **Churn prediction**: predicting whether a cust will stop using the product
