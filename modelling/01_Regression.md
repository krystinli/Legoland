## Linear vs Logistic Regression ðŸ“ˆ
[[KDD]](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/03/linear-logistic-regression-succinct-explanation.html#:~:text=Linear%20Regression%20and%20Logistic%20Regression,used%20to%20solve%20Classification%20problems.) To recap, Supervised Learning is when the algorithm learns on a **labeled dataset** and analyses the training data. These labeled data sets **have inputs and expected outputs**.
- The relation between Linear vs Logistic Regression is the fact that they use labeled datasets to make predictions
- However, the main difference between them is how they are being used:
  - **Linear** Regression is used to solve **Regression** problems:
    - Regression is about predicting a continuous output
    - by finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables 
  - **Logistic** Regression is used to solve **Classification** problems:
    - Classification is about predicting a label
    - by identifying which category an object belongs to based on different parameters
