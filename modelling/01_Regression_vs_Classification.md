## Logistic vs. Linear Regression 📈
Supervised Learning is when the algorithm learns on a **labeled dataset** and analyses the training data. These labeled data sets have inputs and expected outputs.

The relation between Linear vs Logistic Regression is the fact that:
- They both use labeled datasets to make predictions, but:
- **1) Linear Regression** is used to solve `Regression problems`:
  - Predicting a **continuous** output
  - by finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables 
- **2) Logistic Regression** is used to solve `Classification problems`:
  - Classification is about **predicting a label**
  - by identifying which category an object belongs to based on different parameters 



## 1) Regression
- Make predictions on continuous dep variables with the assistance and knowledge from independent variables
- The goal is to find the line of best fit, to be used to predict the output for continuous dependent variables
- Examples of continuous values: house prices 🏚️, age 👵, and salary 💰

## 2) Classification
