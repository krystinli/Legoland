## Logistic vs. Linear Regression üìà
Supervised Learning is when the algorithm learns on a **labeled dataset** and analyses the training data. These labeled data sets have inputs and expected outputs.

The relation between Linear vs Logistic Regression is the fact that:
- They both use labeled datasets to make predictions, but:
- **1) Linear Regression** is used to solve `regression problems`:
  - Predicting a **continuous** output
  - by finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables 
- **2) Logistic Regression** is used to solve `classification problems`:
  - Classification is about **predicting a label**
  - by identifying which category an object belongs to based on different parameters 

## 1) Linear Regression
Make predictions on _continuous_ dependent variables with the knowledge from independent variables:
- The goal is to find the best fitting line, to be used to predict the output Y (continuous dependent variables)
- Examples: house prices üèöÔ∏è, age üëµ, and salary üí∞
- Simple Linear Regression is a regression model that:
  - Estimates the relationship between 1 independent variable and 1 dependent variable using a straight line
  - Multiple Linear Regression: ff there are >2 independent variables
- Assuming linear relationship:

## 2) Classification
Make predictions on _categorical_ dependent variable with the knowledge of independent variables:
- Logistic Regression can be used for both Regression and Classification tasks
- Example: whether it will rain today or not, by using 0 or 1, yes or no, or true and false ‚òÇÔ∏è
