# Decision Trees ðŸŒ³
Are used for residual modeling (ReMo): 
- we fit a tree to the residuals for another model 
- and identify features that're important in modeling those residuals 
- **Residual**: diff btw model prediction and true value 
- basis for **Random Forests** (RF) and **Gradient Boosted Machines** (GBM)
