### 1) Problem solving is search
People solve problems by searching through a problem space:
- A problem space is like a maze: you know where you are now; you’d know if you’ve reached the exit 
- But you don’t know how to get there
- Along the way, you’re constrained in your movements by the maze’s walls

### Learning is the process of acquiring patterns and methods to cut down on brute-force searching
- Searching through the space of possibilities is a characterization of what people do when solving unfamiliar problems
- Meaning when they don’t yet have a method or memory that guides them directly to the answer
- One implication is that, without prior knowledge, most problems are really difficult to solve

### 2) Memory strengthens by retrieval
Retrieving knowledge strengthens memory more than seeing something for a second time does
- Testing knowledge isn’t just a way of measuring what you know — it actively improves your memory
- The brain economizes effort by remembering only those things that are likely to prove useful

### 3) Knowledge grows exponentially
How much you’re able to learn depends on what you already know:
- The the amount of knowledge retained from a text depends on prior knowledge of the topic
- As you learn new things, you integrate them into what you already know
- This integration provides more hooks for you to recall that information later

The early phases of learning are often the hardest and can give a misleading impression of future difficulty within a field

### 4) Creativity is mostly copying
Rather than springing into the world fully-formed, new invention is essentially the random mutation of old ideas

### 5) Skills are specific
Transfer refers to enhanced abilities in one task after practice or training in a different task
- Practice at a task makes you better at it and helps with similar tasks
- Practice at one task helps little with unrelated tasks, even if they seem to require the same broad abilities

While skills may be specific, breadth creates generality:
- Knowing one idea may matter little, but mastering many can give enormous power

### 6) Mental bandwidth is extremely limited
Subliminal learning doesn’t work
- George Miller initially pegged the number at seven, plus or minus two items
- But more recent work has suggested the number is closer to four things
- Devoting bandwidth to irrelevant elements may slow us down

Cognitive load thoery:
- Problem solving may be counterproductive for beginners. Novices do better when shown worked examples (solutions)
- Materials should be designed to avoid needing to flip between pages
- Redundant information impedes learning
- Complex ideas can be learned more easily when presented first in parts

### 7) Success is the best teacher
We learn more from success than failure - aim for a roughly 85% success rate when learning
- Problem spaces are typically large, and most solutions are wrong
- Knowing what works cuts down the possibilities dramatically
- whereas experiencing failure only tells you one specific strategy doesn’t work

### 8) We reason through examples
Logic can’t be acquired from experience. Somehow, we must already know the rules of logic
- Learning is often faster through examples than abstract descriptions
- To learn a general pattern, we need many examples
- We must watch out when making broad inferences based on a few examples

### 9) Knowledge becomes invisible with experience
Skills become increasingly automated through practice. This reduces our conscious awareness of the skill.
- When knowledge becomes tacit, it becomes harder to make explicit how you make a decision
