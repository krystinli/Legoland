### 1) Problem solving is search
People solve problems by searching through a problem space:
- A problem space is like a maze: you know where you are now; you’d know if you’ve reached the exit 
- But you don’t know how to get there
- Along the way, you’re constrained in your movements by the maze’s walls

### Learning is the process of acquiring patterns and methods to cut down on brute-force searching
- Searching through the space of possibilities is a characterization of what people do when solving unfamiliar problems
- Meaning when they don’t yet have a method or memory that guides them directly to the answer
- One implication is that, without prior knowledge, most problems are really difficult to solve

### 2) Memory strengthens by retrieval
Retrieving knowledge strengthens memory more than seeing something for a second time does
- Testing knowledge isn’t just a way of measuring what you know — it actively improves your memory
- The brain economizes effort by remembering only those things that are likely to prove useful

### 3) Knowledge grows exponentially
