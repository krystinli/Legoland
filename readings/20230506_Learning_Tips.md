### 1) Problem solving is search
People solve problems by searching through a problem space:
- A problem space is like a maze: you know where you are now; you’d know if you’ve reached the exit 
- But you don’t know how to get there
- Along the way, you’re constrained in your movements by the maze’s walls

### Learning is the process of acquiring patterns and methods to cut down on brute-force searching
- Searching through the space of possibilities 
- Is a good characterization of what people do when solving unfamiliar problems
- Meaning when they don’t yet have a method or memory that guides them directly to the answer
- One implication is that, without prior knowledge, most problems are really difficult to solve
