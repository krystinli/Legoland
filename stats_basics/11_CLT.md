## Central_Limit_Theorem
For large sample sizes: [CLT](https://medium.com/@seema.singh/central-limit-theorem-simplified-46ddefeb13f3)
- The sampling distribution of means will approximate to normal distribution even if the population distribution is not normal
- A sample of **size 30** is considered large enough to see the effect and power of Central Limit Theorem
  - The closer the population distribution to normal distribution, fewer samples needed to demonstrate Central Limit Theorem.

For a randome sample taken from a population:
