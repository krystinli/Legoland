## What does "stat sig" mean?
- Statistically significance means that a difference between 2 groups is NOT just due to chance

  - ie. A marketing campaign ("treatment") to a sample results in a stat-sig +10% increase in conversion vs. the control group, we can be confident that this increase is due to the campaign effect, not just chance
