## When do you use T-test instead of Z-test?

### Z-Test
The distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution
- Tests the mean of a distribution in which we already **know the population variance**
- Approximate Z-tests if the sample size is large or the population variance is known.

### T-Test
- If the **population variance is unknown**
- and the sample size is not large (n < 30)
