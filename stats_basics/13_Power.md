# Power ðŸ”‹
The power of a test is the **probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis** (1-beta, type II err), or true positive rate. The power of your test increases with sample size. 
- This should intuitively make sense as a larger sample means that you have collected more information -- which makes it easier to correctly reject the null hypothesis when you should.
- To ensure that your sample size is big enough, you will need to conduct a power analysis calculation, which require:
  - What type of test you plan to use (e.g., independent t-test, paired t-test, ANOVA, regression, ...)
  - The alpha value or significance level you are using (usually 0.01 or 0.05)
  - The expected effect size
  - The sample size you are planning to use

AB test: 
- Group A, group B, there is a 5% lift in group B relative to group A (B = A + 5%)
- Run another AB test, group B, group C, there is a 5% lift in group C relative to group B (C = B + 5%)
- Then what's the lift in group C relative to group A. (C should be 10% higher than group A) 

### 01_Significance_Level_and_Rejection_Region
- The rejection region depends on the significance level. 
- The significance level is denoted by Î± and is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is true. 

### 02_Critical_Value
A point on the scale of the test statistic beyond which we reject the null hypothesis
- Derived from the level of significance Î± of the test
- It depends upon a test statistic, which is specific to the type of test
- The significance level, Î±, defines the sensitivity of the test

### 03_Error
- **Type I error** is the rejection of a true null hypothesis
- **Type II error** is the non-rejection of a false null hypothesis.

### 04_MDE
MDE measures the experiment sensitivity:
- A minimum improvement over the conversion rate of the existing asset
  - (Baseline conversion rate) that you want the experiment to detect
- Highly sensitive settings, or low MDE, come along with a big sample size
- The lower the MDE is, the more traffic you need to detect minor changes, hence the more money you have to spend on driving that traffic

**Q1: If decrease the effect size by half, how to adjust sample size to achieve the same statistical power, assume standard deviation remains the same?**
