## 4 Stages to become a Data Driven Company

### Stage1_Crawl 👶
Build foundational prerequisites to compute the **summary stats** needed for hypothesis testing
- To run a few experiements to guide business directions

### Stage2_Walk 🚶‍♀️
Shift goal from prerequisites to focus on **defining standard metrics**
- Run more experiments
- Impprove trust by validating instrumentation
  - Run A/A tests 
  - Sample ratio mismatch (SRM) test 

### Stage3_Run 🏃‍♀️
Shift goal to running experiments at scale 
- Metrics are comprehensive 
- Codify an OEC that captures tradeoffs btw multiple metrics
- The org uses experimentation to evaluate most new features and changes

### Stage4_Fly 💸
Running A/B tes as the norm for every change
- Feature teams can analyze most experiments without the help from DS's
- The focus shifts from automation to support this scale 
- Establishing institutional memory: a record of all experiemnts and changes made which enable learning from the past
