# Confidence Interval
A confidence interval displays the probability that a parameter will fall between a pair of values around the mean. 
- Confidence intervals measure the degree of uncertainty in a sampling method. 
- They are most often constructed using confidence levels of 95% or 99%. 
  - A confidence interval of 95% means: it is 95% certain that our population parameter lies in between this range

### How to calculate the CI of x/y given they're normally distributed?
`CI = best estimate +/- margin of error` [calculation](https://towardsdatascience.com/confidence-interval-calculation-and-characteristics-1a60fd724e1d)
- margin of error = Z score * estimated SE, ![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/520/1*8QxKNlPy9nznEwRQgzBSvg.png)
  - p1 is the best estimate
  - n is the sample size
- z- score for a few commonly used confidence level:
