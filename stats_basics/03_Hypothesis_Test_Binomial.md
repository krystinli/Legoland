## Hypothesis Testing with Binomial Distribution
To hypothesis test with the binomial distribution, we must calculate the probability **p** of the observed event and any more extreme event happening. We compare this to the level of significance **α**:
- If `p > α` then we **do not reject** the null hypothesis
- If `p < α` then we **accept** the alternative hypothesis

### Coin Flipping 🪙
A coin is tossed 20 times, landing on heads 6 times. Perform a hypothesis test at a 5% significance level to see if the coin is biased:
- H0: The coin is not biased (ie. This happens at random)
- H1: The coin is biased in favour of tails (This is not random)

The important thing to note here is that we only need a **one-tailed** test as the alternative hypothesis says “in favour of tails”. A **two-tailed** test would be the result of an alternative hypothesis saying “The coin is biased”.
