## What does "stat sig" mean? 🎯
- Statistically significance means that a difference between 2 groups is NOT just due to chance 🥎
  - When a result is stat-sig, we can be "confidence" that the difference is real ☑️
  - ie. A marketing campaign ("treatment") to a sample results in a stat-sig +10% increase in conversion vs. the control group, we can be confident that this increase is due to the campaign effect, not just chance  

### Stat-sig vs. P-Value 🧵
**Statistical significance** is quantified in **p-value**:
- Q: How likely it is for the difference we see to occur under the the null hypothesis?
  - The H0 is the claim that an experimentally observed diff is due to chance alone
    - ie. There's no diff between treamtment & the control groups
  - The HA contradicts H0 says that experimentally observed difference CANNOT be due to chance
    - ie. There's areal diff! 
- We usually consider a `p-value < 0.05` to be stat-sig:
  -  This means under the null hypothesis, assuming that there's no diff between treatment and control,
    - There's <5% chance the difference we observe is due to chance alone
    - As a result, we can reject H0; 
    - This also means, we might call a result stat-sig by mistabke 1 in 20 times!
