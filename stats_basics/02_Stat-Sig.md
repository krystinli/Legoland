## What does "stat sig" mean? 🎯
- Statistically significance means that a difference between 2 groups is NOT just due to chance 🥎
  - When a result is stat-sig, we can be "confidence" that the difference is real ☑️
  - ie. A marketing campaign ("treatment") to a sample results in a stat-sig +10% increase in conversion vs. the control group, we can be confident that this increase is due to the campaign effect, not just chance  

### Stat-sig vs. P-Value 🧵
**Statistical significance is quantified in p-value**
- Q: How likely it is for the difference we see to occur under the the null hypothesis?
  - The H0 is the claim that an experimentally observed diff is due to chance alone => no real difference
  - The HA (contradicts H0) says that experimentally observed difference CANNOT be due to chance => T/C are different!

**We usually consider a `p-value < 0.05` to be stat-sig:**
- This means there's <5% chance the difference we observe is due to chance alone; hence we can reject H0; 
- This also means we might call a result stat-sig by mistabke 1 in 20 times!
