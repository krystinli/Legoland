**Variance:** 
- The average squared difference of the values from the mean 
- It measures how spread out a set of data is relative to mean

**Standard Deviation:** 
- The standard difference between each data point and the mean 
- The square root of variance

**Standard Error(SE):** 
- An estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

### 01_Descriptive_Stats
Where're Mode, Median, and Mean for different skewness?

**Metrics**
- **Mean:** The average of the dataset.
- **Median:** The middle value of an ordered dataset.
- **Mode:** The most frequently value in the dataset; we could have a multimodal distribution.
- **Skewness:** A measure of symmetry. If a distribution is right-skewed, what's the relationship between medium, mode, and mean?
- **Kurtosis:** A measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution

### 02_Variability ðŸ‘¾
- **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest value in the dataset.
- **Percentiles:** A measure that indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls.
- **Quantiles:** Values that divide the number of data points into four more or less equal parts, or quarters.
- **Interquartile Range(IQR)**: A measure of statistical dispersion and variability based on dividing a data set into quartiles. `IQR = Q3âˆ’Q1`

### 03_Relationship_Between_Variables
- **Causality:** Relationship between two events where one event is affected by the other.
- **Covariance:** A quantitative measure of the joint variability between two or more variables.
- **Correlation:** Measure the relationship between two variables and ranges from -1 to 1, the normalized version of covariance.
