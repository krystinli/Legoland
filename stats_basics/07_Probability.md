# Probability ♟️
The measure of the likelihood that an event will occur in a Random Experiment.
- Complement: `P(A)+P(A’)=1`
- Intersection: `P(A∩B)=P(A)P(B)`
- Union: `P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)`

### Independent Events
- Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other. 
- `P(A|B)=P(A)` and `P(B|A)=P(B)` because:
  - `P(A∩B)=P(A)P(B)` where `P(A) != 0` and `P(B) != 0`
  - `P(A∩B)=P(B|A).P(A)`

### Mutually Exclusive Events
- Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur at the same time. 
- `P(A∩B)=0` and `P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)`
