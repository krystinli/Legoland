## Difference in difference
- Analytical approach that facilitates **causal inference** even when randomization is not possible
- We cannot draw causal conclusions by observing simple before-and-after changes in outcomes
  - as factors other than the treatment may influence the outcome over time
- Difference-in-differences compare the before-and-after changes in outcomes for treatment and control groups
  - to estimate the overall impact of the program
